# Problem 5

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

# Notes

* If iterating it is pointless to go increase in steps less than 20 as they, by definition, will not divide by 20 without remainder
